I start my career as part time lecture in 1st of October 2005 PHP programming inn WinSys academy . in 2009  join  as lecture for computer science subject in Maldives . and 2012 join with GIS campus as a computer science lecture. In 2016 join as ict lecture e-soft metro campus conducting web application development. And wireless networking for BSC students. I have work as private tutor student from Malaysia and Italy.  

Education :
 
After finishing secondary school, I enrolled as a BSc student at USJP (https://www.sjp.ac.lk/) from 2003 to 2007, where I studied computer science, math, and physics. Learn fundamental to advanced C++ programming, PHP and SQL, MySQL development, and painting games using C++ visuals. Integrate an Access database and Excel spreadsheet with Windows-based apps.

I start my master in applied electronics in 2011 and finish 2016 in that learn microcontroller programming , sensors and data send receive using Http / Bluetooth /Zigbee/ I2c and rs232. Develop tide monitoring system as my final project. 

In 2018 I start my PhD in Malaysia the topic of deep recurrent neural networks (AI) time series forecasting using python. But due to pandamic I couldn‚Äôt finish it. 


In 2022 I start my master in Data science (UWE-UK) plan to finish in January 2023 completed all modules with distinction pass final project is pending . work with power BI , Tablue and development skill about data migration processing and presenting. Forecasting time series data use of python and python flask application.
